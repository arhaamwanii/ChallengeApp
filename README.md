    - HOW TO BUIDL SCROLL BASED ANIMATION 

- simple sessions are happening in css
- css TRANSITIONS
    - we choose a css elemet i.e  display , transform
    - once a change occurs in the element
    - we can set the time on it liek 
    - transition = transform 3s 
        - this will get the element to do what it is supposed to in 3s rather then immediately 
- css ANIMATION 
    - at key frames 
    - from to 
    - these things are reusble to be added to the className directly
        - animation : nameOfTheAnimation "time" "ease-in" 'forward' 

BUT WE CAN'T ANIMATE THE DISAPPEARANCE
